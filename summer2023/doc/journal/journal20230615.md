## Methods

Great start to build the factor/feature library. We need to do some adjustment in the way features are calculated. Before revising the code, go through the tutorial below:  

1. Long and Wide format of the data [https://www.statology.org/long-vs-wide-data/](https://www.statology.org/long-vs-wide-data/). Understand how to do this in pandas pd.wide_to_long  
2. Understand group by apply opertations. Next, understand how to do this in pandas. [https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.08-aggregation-and-grouping.html](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.08-aggregation-and-grouping.html) `I found this book very helpful`


## Momentum factor 

Now come back to the momentum factor code. Now, you will have to adjust the stock_selection.py code to do same calculations for each group. 

Basically sort by ticker and date. Since date is index so already sorted. Then groupby ticker/symbol and apply all the calculations of stock_selection.py. Below I have give example how I calculated one of the momentum features for each group. This is just an example there are many ways choose the way that appeals most to you. 

```python
def mom_oh_oc(group):
    group["oh"] = np.log(group.loc[:, "high"].rolling(11).max().div(group.loc[:, "open"].shift(12)))
    group["hc"] = np.log(
        group.loc[:, "close"].div(group.loc[:, "high"].rolling(11).max())
    )
    return(group)
    
def get_momentum_decompose(data):
    # Below assumes ticker as column and date as index
    # If multiindex dataframe with ticker as one level the change groupby to groupby(level = "ticker")
    data = (data
            # group i.e. split by ticker sorted by date
            .groupby("ticker")
            #Apply functions mom_oh_oc or features to calculate for each group/stock
            .apply(mom_oh_oc)
    )
    return(data)

```
